Not sure if you were aware... but Fullstack has some secret Pokemon trainers! Through careful research (and shameless stalking), I've been able to compile a database of all the trainers!

Instructions:

1. Fork this repo.
2. `git clone` the repo to your machine.
3. `npm install`.
4. Set up the database in Postgres using the CLI function: `createdb dealers_choice_pokemon`.
5. Open up `localhost:3002` in your browser.
